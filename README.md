# Digit Classifier

This project is currently not finished and is still in development. Currently it provides a gui for manipulating and 
training networks. See functionality below.

Originally this project was made for me to learn about how basic classifiers work by making one with out using any high 
level python libraries such as TensorFlow. Instead I decided to use numpy which helped me much better learn the basics
of neural networks as I had to implement algorithms such as back propagation by my self.

<b>Functionality</b>

- Run a selected Network with drawing gui

- Create new, load and save networks

- Non GUI training program available in networks/main_train.py

<b>TODO</b>

- Add training functionality to GUI

- Add debug tools to GUI

- create graphing tool
